# User Experience Design Fundamentals

## What is UXD?
According to [Joe Natoli](https://www.givegoodux.com/), UXD is the sum of a simple equation:

```
  business goals
  user/customer goals
  user interface
+ back-end process
-------------------------
  user experience design
```

UXD explores solutions to design problems, balancing innovation, desirability, feasibility, and viability.

## Attributes
The attributes of UXD can be illustrated in the "UX Honeycomb":

## Elements
There are five interdependent "planes" that build upon each other:

1. **Strategry**: The site, system, or app's reason for being
   - User needs, business objectives
2. **Scope**: Features and functions contained within the site, system, or app
   - Functional specifications, content requirements
3. **Structure**: The number of places you can go, organized contextrually
   - Interaction design, information architecture
4. **Skeleton**: The optimized organization and arrangement of visual elements
   - Interface design, navigation design, information design
5. **Surface**: UI screens; images, text, things with which the user can interact
   - visual design

## Research
An overview of strategic UX research:

1. **Stakeholder interviews**: Anyone who has a vested interest in the product
2. **Competitor review**: Look into competitors, their strengths and weaknesses, including reviews
3. **User interviews and/or research**: Investigate how and why users attempt to solve common problems
   - "If you had to complete Task A, how would you do that?"
4. **Audit existing product**: Conduct all the above with the existing product
5. **Analysis and review**: Look for patterns then make informed decisions
