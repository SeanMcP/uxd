# User Experience Design Fundamentals

## What is UXD?
According to [Joe Natoli](https://www.givegoodux.com/), UXD is the sum of a simple equation:

```
  business goals
  user/customer goals
  user interface
+ back-end process
-------------------------
  user experience design
```

UXD explores solutions to design problems, balancing innovation, desirability, feasibility, and viability.
